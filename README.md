# genshin-bartender-auto-recipes

Genshin Bartender Auto Recipes is the python program for the action-RPG game Genshin Impact. It is mainly intended to show the recipe of a drink in 'Of Drink A-Dreaming' an upcoming event in Genshin Impact 2.5 Update.

It uses win32gui to capture a screenshot of the game window and match that screen with a menu's image with open-cv.

# Can this get me banned?
According to miHoYo's response to Script, Plug-In, and Third-Party Software, we believe not.

- This program does not exploit the game. It only takes pictures of the game window and find the order name.
- This program does not provide artificial in-game progress. The player is the only one who does the process during the bartending event
- This program does nothing to provide account selling/exchanging.
- Doesn't provide Top-up Primogems.

But it's not mean it will actually be safe to use forever. Use at your own risk. We will not be responsible to your game account for any action decided by Hoyolab
